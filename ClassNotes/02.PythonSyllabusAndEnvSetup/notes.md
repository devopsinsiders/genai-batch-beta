# Environment Setup

To install Python on Windows, you can follow these steps:

1. **Download Python Installer:**
   - Go to the [Python official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - Click on the "Downloads" tab and select the latest version of Python for Windows. At the time of writing, the latest version is Python 3.10.1.
   - Scroll down to the "Files" section and click on the Windows installer (either 32-bit or 64-bit, depending on your system).

2. **Run the Installer:**
   - Once the installer is downloaded, double-click on it to run it.
   - Check the box that says "Add Python 3.x to PATH" (replace '3.x' with the version number you downloaded).
   - Click on "Install Now."

3. **Installation Process:**
   - The installer will copy the necessary files and install Python on your system.
   - It will also install pip (Python's package installer) and optionally add Python to your system PATH.

4. **Verify Installation:**
   - Open a command prompt by pressing `Win + R`, typing `cmd`, and pressing Enter.
   - Type `python --version` and press Enter. You should see the version number of Python installed (e.g., Python 3.10.1).
   - You can also type `pip --version` to verify that pip is installed.

5. **Optional: Install a Text Editor or IDE:**
   - While not necessary, you may want to install a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to write and run your Python code more efficiently. Popular choices include Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, and IDLE (included with Python).

That's it! Python should now be installed on your Windows system, and you can start writing and running Python code.
